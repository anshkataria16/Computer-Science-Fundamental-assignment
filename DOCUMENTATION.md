## 2. Development Process

### Step 1: Planning
- Decided to build a console-based calculator using Python.
- Listed required operations: +, -, ×, ÷.

### Step 2: Writing Code
- Created `calculator.py` file.
- Wrote a menu driven program.
- using if,elif and else.
- Added a error code if option is wrong.

### Step 3: Testing the Code
- Tested each operations with different inputs.
- Ensured the program runs without crashing.

### Step 4: Git & GitHub Usage
- Initialized Git repository using `git init`.
- Added files with `git add .`
- Made multiple commits with clear messages.
- Pushed code to GitHub using:
git push -u origin main

## 3. Future Improvements
- Add square root, percentage, and power functions.
- Add memory functions (M+, M-, MR).
- Add unit tests using Python's unittest module.

## 4. Conclusion
This project improved skills in:
- Python programming  
- Git version control  
- Using VS Code  
- Writing documentation
